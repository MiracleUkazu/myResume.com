                I have engaged in several extracurriculars that can be found properly detailed on my <span>CV</span> in the link below. <br>
                This extracurriculars include <span>Community Service</span> where I cleaned the
                orphanage and helped raise money for
                orphans and disabled children, raising
                enough to feed over 3000 children for
                two months and buy a few clothing
                items. I taught 20 young
                children math and English. They
                learned to add, count to 50, and spell
                two- and three-letter words. <br><br>
                <span>Technology</span> where I created a website, The Hive,
                which focused on spreading awareness
                about climate change, enabling
                people to share how it has affected
                them and volunteer to help fight one
                of the most challenging problems in
                the world today. With the help of my collegues the site was able to get publicity and was
                featured in Business and Financial
                Times, which is one of the top-ranked
                newspapers in Ghana, reaching over
                300,000 people.
                <br><br>
                <span>Hostel Captain and President of the Arts club</span> were I made school
                decorations for important occasions
                in school and origanized and cultural art exhibition where people of different cultures all over Africa would represnt their love for their culture. I took care of 24 dorm members, ensured the dorm was tidy and mentored and tutored students in Science and Math. I learned a lot about
                teamwork and communication from
                them.
